# Git-and-GitHub-101

## Objectives

After completing this unit you will be able to:

* Explain what the terms _source code management_ and _revision control_ system mean.
* Explain the purpose of _Git_ and _GitHub_ and what makes them different.
* Create up an account on GitHub.
* Explain what a _Git [repository][]_ is.
* Create a new git _repository_ on GitHub.
* Use git to:
  - **[clone][]** a repository that you want to work on.
  - **[add][]** a file so that it is tracked by git.
  - **[commit][]** a set of changes to you have made.
  - **[push][]** your changes to GitHub.
  - **[pull][]** the latest changes from GitHub.
  - check the **[status][]** of a project under git.
  - view a **[log][]** of changes made to the project.
  - see **[diff][]**&#8203;erences between versions of files you are working on.

Once you have mastered these skills you will have the basics of using git to manage a personal project and by maintaining your repository on GitHub you will be able to easily work on a project at home and at school. You will also be ready to "level up" to use git in team projects.

What separates using git on your own from work in a team project is the possibility of _merge conflicts_ – conflicts between changes that you have made and those made by someone else on the project team. The essential skills for using git as a member of a team are:

1. Avoiding merge conflicts, and
2. Resolving merge conflicts.

To avoid merge conflicts you first try to avoid having multiple people working on the same files, and use the Git **[branch][]** and **[merge][]** facilities to manage potential conflicts.

## Git / GitHub Skills

Managing versions and changes on a multi-user project can become very complex, good "git hygine" helps a lot, but it is still very possible to make a big mess in a hurry...

Attention to detail and practicing (a lot) will go a long way to developing a solid set of skills that will add depth to your resume. We'll take this is bite size chunks so that it doesn't get too overwhelming.

### Setting up an account on GitHub

If you don't already have one, the first step is to create an account on [GitHub][]. Click on the link, you'll be greated by a sign-up form like this:

Take the time to come up with a good username - your first and last name is a good choice – if you continue in computer science your GitHub account is likely to be a source of connections and also a feature on your resume.

Use an e-mail account that you have access to so that you can verify your account.

Make sure that you choose a password that you will not forget. Note that they **do not** ask you to verify your password. Make sure that you have it right! You may want to type it in the clear and the cut and paste it into the form.

### Working online

### Using Git on the command online

### Using Git from IntelliJ

## Branches, Code Reviews, and Merge Conflicts
