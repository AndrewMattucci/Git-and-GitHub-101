# Git-and-GitHub-101

## Objectives

After completing this unit you will be able to:

* Explain what the terms _source code management_ and _revision control_ system mean.
* Explain the purpose of _Git_ and _GitHub_ and what makes them different.
* Create up an account on GitHub.
* Explain what a _Git [repository][]_ is.
* Create a new git _repository_ on GitHub.
* Use git to:
  - **[clone][]** a repository that you want to work on.
  - **[add][]** a file so that it is tracked by git.
  - **[commit][]** a set of changes to you have made.
  - **[push][]** your changes to GitHub.
  - **[pull][]** the latest changes from GitHub.
  - check the **[status][]** of a project under git.
  - view a **[log][]** of changes made to the project.
  - see **[diff][]**erences between versions of files you are working on.

Once you have mastered these skills you will have the basics of using git to manage a personal project and by maintaining your repository on GitHub you will be able to easily work on a project at home and at school. You will also be ready to "level up" to use git in team projects.

What separates using git on your own from work in a team project is the possibility of _merge conflicts_ â€“ conflicts between changes that you have made and those made by someone else on the project team. The essential skills for using git as a member of a team are:

1. Avoiding merge conflicts, and
2. Resolving merge conflicts.

To avoid merge conflicts you first try to avoid having multiple people working on the same files, and use the Git **[branch][]** and **[merge][]** facilities to manage potential conflicts.
